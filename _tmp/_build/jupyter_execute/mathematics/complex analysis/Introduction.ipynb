    "In complex analysis we are dealing with the set of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ which are ordered pairs of the form $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. If we introduce the imaginary unit $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ we can write it in its *rectangular form*:\n",

    "Every complex number $z = x + iy$ has a **real part** Re$z = x$ and an **imaginary part** Im$z = y$. Sometimes $\\mathfrak{R}(z)$ and $\\mathfrak{I}(z)$ are used instead of Re and Im. Two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ are equal iff their real and imaginary parts are equal,\n",

    "If Re$(z) = 0$ and Im$(z) \\neq 0$ we say that $z$ is *pure imaginary*. On the other hand, if Im$(z) = 0$ and Re$(z) \\neq 0$ we recover the *pure real* number $x$. Therefore, we identify real numbers as complex numbers whose imaginary part is equal to 0, so $\\mathbb{R}$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{C}$, i.e. $\\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}$.\n",
