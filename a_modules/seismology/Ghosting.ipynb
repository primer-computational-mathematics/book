    "In marine acquisition, the source and receiver are both towed slightly below the sea surface, this leads to a reflection from the sea surface just above the source receiver. This reflection is refered as \"ghosting\".\n",

    "<img src=\"images/ghost.png\" style=\"width:300px;height:200px\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ghosting results in a noisier trace. The interaction of these two signals also leads to regular “notches” in the frequency spectrum, which can limit the bandwidth. The location of these notches $f_{n}$ is dependant on the depth $d$ of the source and receivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{n}=\\frac{v}{2d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing survey, we need to achieve a delicate balance between the depth of the sources and receivers (deeper = quieter!) and the expected location of the notch (deeper = notch at lower frequency i.e. more reduced bandwidth!).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/notch.png\" style=\"width:300px;height:400px\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific operators can be designed to remove the ghost and balance the amplitude of the frequencies in the ghost notch during processing, Where possible may be more convenient to filter out the notched data."
