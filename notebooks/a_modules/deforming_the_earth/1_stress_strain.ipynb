    "## Stress\n",
    "Stress is defined as the force per unit area, $ \\frac{F}{A} $, applied on a body by external forces. There are two types of stress, **Normal** and **Shear**. Stresses are normal if a force acts perpendicularly to the surface of an object. Normal stresses can be compressional or tensional. Shear stress is the force per unit areain a direction parallel to the area to which it is applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "The units of stress are $\\text{N/m}^2$, Pa, or Bars ($\\text{10}^5$ Pa)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strain\n",
    "Strain is the deformation (e.g. elongation/contraction) experienced by a body due to an applied strain. Stress can lead to changes in volume, size, and orientation of objects. **Homogenous** strain is when straight lines on the object remain straight, and where strain is the same throughout the body. **Heterogenous** strain is where strain is non-uniform throughout the body."
