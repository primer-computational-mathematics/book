    "\n",
    "We can envisage sets $\\mathbb{R}^1, \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}^3$ geometrically. For example, we think of triplets $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as points in the entire 3-D coordinate space with coordinates $x_1, x_2, x_3$. The standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a set of vectors $\\{ e_1, e_2, e_3 \\}$ which we might denote as unit vectors $\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n > 3$ we do not have a geometrical image of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For example, we can represent wind velocity $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ at time $t$ in space with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ as a point $(v_1, v_2, v_3, t, x, y, z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^7$.\n",

    "As suggested by the title, we can therefore consider matrix multiplication as a change of basis. Say we are multiplying $A \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}$. What this means is that the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is the vector $\\mathbf{u}$ transformed in the basis formed by the columns of $A$."
