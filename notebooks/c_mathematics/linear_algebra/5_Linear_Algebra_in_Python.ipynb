    "# Linear Algebra in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is of vital importance in almost any area of science and engineering and therefore numerical linear algebra is just as important in computational science. Some of the more popular areas of application include machine learning, computer vision, finite element method, optimisation, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers use a discrete representation of the real numbers, rather than a continuous one, which has several consequences. Most notably, it means that there have to be gaps between adjacent numbers. We will therefore most often want to work with [floating point numbers with double precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) (*float* in python) which allow us to represent real numbers with very high precision. However, often in computing we deal with extremely large datasets (e.g. matrices with millions of rows and columns) so even tiny errors can grow and accumulate very fast if our algorithm is [*numerically unstable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might be tempted to solve $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ by calculating an inverse of A, but calculating inverses and determinants of matrices is generally avoided in computing due to round-off errors. Numerical linear algebra therefore aims to come up with fast and efficient algorithms to solve usual linear algebra problems without magnifying these (and other) small errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The main library for linear algebra in Python is [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) which makes use of NumPy arrays. NumPy also provides plenty of basic functionalities through its functions in [``numpy.linalg``](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html), but many advanced capabilities remain reserved for [``scipy.linalg``](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/linalg.html).

The former constructs a square matrix with n rows and columns with 1s on the main diagonal. The latter constructs an $n \\times m$ matrix with 1s on the kth diagonal (k=0 is the main diagonal).

Performing operations on sparse matrices can therefore be unnecessarily computationally expensive, since we are unnecessarily adding 0s or multiplying by 0, for example. Therefore, when working with sparse matrices we would like to have an option to simply skip this kind of operations.\n",

There are several formats how these matrices are stored and users are encouraged to read the documentation and the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) for an explanation of them. For example, a sparse matrix in coordinate format is stored in three arrays: one for the values of non-zero entries and two for the row and column index of those entries.\n",

For example, we can use the function [`scipy.sparse.coo_matrix`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html) to construct a matrix in COOrdinate format. Let us convert a tridiagonal NumPy matrix to a sparse SciPy matrix."

    "#### Reshaping arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that 1-D NumPy arrays remain unchanged when transposed. To avoid this kind of issues, column (or row) vectors should be initialised as 2-D $n \\times 1$ (or $1 \\times n$) arrays. Below demonstrates this, as well as how to reshape 1-D arrays to 2-D. A very useful method of doing this is by giving -1 as one of the new shape parameters. We cannot give -1 for more than one shape parameter, as this is the unknown value which NumPy will figure out for us. For example, if we start from a 1-D array of 4 entries, reshaping it to (-1, 1, 2) will generate an array of shape $k \\times 1 \\times 2$ where $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ has to satisfy $k \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$ so that the total number of entries (A.size in NumPy) is preserved. If this $k$ does not exist, the reshaping is not possible."
