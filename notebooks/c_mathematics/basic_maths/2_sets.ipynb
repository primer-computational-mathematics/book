    "The notions of a *set* and an *element of a set* are some of the most primitive ones in mathematics so we normally do not even define them. However, intuitively, a set represents a collection of objects, which we call its elements. These objects can be anything: numbers, vectors, other sets... The reader might, understandably, be dissatisfied with this circular interpretation of a set as a collection, but hopefully this notebook will provide some intuition about the topic.\n",

    "- We denote a set by listing its elements, in any order we want, inside curly braces. For example, $A = \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}$\n",

    "- A set without any elements is called the **empty set** (or *null* set) and we denote it by $\\emptyset$.\n",
    "- Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a **subset** of $B$, $A \\subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. For example, $\\{ 1, 2 \\} \\subseteq \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}$.\n",

    "**Intersection** $\\cap$. The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is denoted as $A \\cap B$ and it corresponds to the logical $\\land$ (\"and\"). Its result is a set which contains elements that are common in *both* $A$ and $B$. That is, $\\forall x (x \\in A \\cap B) \\iff ((x \\in A) \\land (x \\in B))$.

    "**Union** $\\cup$. The union of sets A and B is denoted as A $\\cup$ B and it corresponds to the logical $\\lor$ (\"or\"). Its result is a set which contains elements which are elements of A or elements of B, i.e. the two sets are \"added\" together. That is, $\\forall x (x \\in A \\cup B) \\iff ((x \\in A) \\lor (x \\in B))$. For example, $ \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\} \\cup \\{ 1, 3, 5 \\} = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 5 \\} $.\n",

We can write that as $\\forall x (x \\in A \\backslash B) \\iff ((x \\in A) \\land (x \\notin B))$. For example, $\\{ 1, 2, 3 \\} \\backslash \\{ 1, 3, 5 \\} = \\{ 2 \\}$ and $ \\{ 1, 2 \\} \\backslash \\{ 1, 2 \\} = \\emptyset $."
