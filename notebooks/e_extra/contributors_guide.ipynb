    "## Adding notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the github directory that creates the jupyter book, only directories with a file 'intro.md' or 'intro.ipynb' will be included in the book. The rest of the directories will be skipped, when creating the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Notes on notebooks\n",
    "* Each directory that includes 'intro.md' will be displayed in the Table of Contents by the first header from the 'intro.md' file. For header style guide, go to {ref}`this section <style_guide_headers>`. Always check if your headers are consistent with other on the website!\n",
    "* If you want an automatically generated table of contents of your notebooks/directories within a specific section, then use directive:\n",
    "````\n",
    "```{tableofcontents}\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "* Do not add Markdown tables of contents into your notebooks, the website will create one in top right corner.\n",
    "* Do not use colloquial language in the notebooks, keep your language professional.\n",
    "* Avoid referring to specific modules, e.g. do not use sentences \"You will learn this in X module\" or \"You should know this from X module\". Instead, refer them to already existing notebooks within the primer.\n",
    "* Avoid using first person perspective and write impersonally or use pronoun \"we\".\n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "## File naming\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the files are sorted with a [natural sorting algorithm](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Natural_sorting), meaning that files are not only sorted in alphabetical order, but also in a human order if numbers appear in the file name. This way, if you want your files to appear in the Table of Contents in a specified order, you can add integers at the begining of each file to sort them accordingly:\n",

    "###### Header level 6\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding style\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the primer is to teach how programming can be used in mathematics, geosciences etc. It is crucial that the code on the website is of good quality and is easy to read for someone who does not have a lot of experience coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is encouraged to use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style, recommended by Python's designer Guide van Rossum. Style guidelines involve recommendations such as naming conventions, commenting standards, line length, white space conventions etc. Adhering to these standards makes the code consistent and easier to follow for someone unfamiliar with your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Tips on how to make a good Python script\n",
    "* Create meaningful variable names, if used more than once. This makes the code easier to understand for other users.\n",
    "* Add only meaningful comments to your code. No need to explain what 1 + 2 does, but it is important to explain why last index is omitted from a loop.\n",
    "* \"Simple is better than complex, but complex is better than complicated.\" - a quote from Zen of Python which you can find [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).\n",
    "* Use functions in your code - do not duplicate your code unnecessarily.\n",
    "* Try to keep things compact, but usually keep one statement per line.\n",
    "* Practice the principle of least astonishment - your code's behaviour should not surprise other users. Write it in a way that it behaves in a way most users will expect it to behave.\n",
    "* Keep your lines shorter than the width of the website.\n",
