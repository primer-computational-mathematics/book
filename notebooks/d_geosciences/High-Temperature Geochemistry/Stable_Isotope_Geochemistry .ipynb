    "# Stable Isotope Geochemistry \n",
    "```{index} isotope fractionation \n",
    "```\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable isotope geochemistry is concerned with isotopic variations that are created by physical-chemical rather than nuclear processes. Radiogenic isotope geochemistry assumes that isotope compositions such ${^{87}Sr}/{^{86}Sr}$ are not affected by processes other than radioactive decay because isotopes of the same element display the same chemical behavior. In detail this is not quite true, however! Isotopes of the same element display small but significant differences in their behavior during physical, chemical and biological processing. Physical (e.g., evaporation, diffusion), chemical (e.g., precipitation,\n",
    "oxidation), and biological processes (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration) can generate small changes in the isotope compositions of the elements – these changes are termed *stable isotope fractionations* or simply (isotope) fractionations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stable isotope fractionations are neglected in radiogenic isotope geochemistry because (i) stable isotope effects are often small compared to the effects of radioactive decay and/or (ii) radiogenic isotope analyses involve an ‘automatic’ correction for any variations introduced by stable isotope fractionations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variations in stable isotope compositions are generally due to mass dependent stable isotope fractionations – this means that the magnitude of the isotope effect depends on the mass difference of the isotopes involved. For example: consider a mixture of $^1H$, $^2H$ (deuterium), and $^3H$ (tritium). If a fractionation process changes the ${^{1}H}/{^{2}H}$ ratio ($\\Delta M = 1\\,amu$) by $0.5\\%$, then the ratio ${^{1}H}/{^{3}H}$ ($\\Delta M = 2\\,amu$) will be altered by $1\\%$. Exceptions to this rule are known but they are extremely rare. \n",
    "\n",
    "The elements which are most commonly studied, and which display the largest fractionations, are $H$, $Li$, $B$, $C$, $N$, $O$, $Si$, $S$, and $Cl$. These are all “light” elements with atomic masses of less than $40\\,amu$. Among these, $H$, $O$, $C$, and $S$ are by far the most important. These elements have several common properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Low atomic mass.\n",
    "   * The relative mass difference between the isotopes is large\n",
    "   * They form bonds with a high degree of covalent character (nonionic)\n",
    "   * The elements exist in more than one oxidation state, form a wide range of compounds, and/or are important constituents of many natural solids and fluids.\n",
    "   * The isotopes are abundant enough ($> 0.1\\%$) to facilitate the isotope ratios measurements \n",
    "\n",
    "It was once thought that elements, which did not meet these criteria would not display significant (= measurable) stable isotope fractionations. Due to recent advances in mass spectrometry, however, geochemists are now able to resolve natural isotopic variations of numerous additional elements, including high-atomic weight trace metals: $Mg$, $Ca$, $Cr$, $Fe$, $Cu$, $Zn$, $Ge$, $Se$, $Mo$, $Cd$, and $Tl$. The natural stable isotope variations of the latter elements are generally smaller than those of the “classic” stable isotope elements. Nonetheless, they are large enough to permit the resolution of geologically useful fractionation effects and such studies of “non-traditional” stable isotope systems are currently attracting a lot of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "## δ Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations in stable isotope ratios are typically in the parts per thousand range and they are hence reported as *permil* deviations from a given isotope standard, using a $\\delta$-notation. For example, $O$ isotope variations are generally reported as permil deviations from the SMOW standard (Standard Mean Ocean Water): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta^{18}O = \\left[\\frac{({^{18}O}/{^{16}O})_{sam} - ({^{18}O}/{^{16}O})_{std}}{({^{18}O}/{^{16}O})_{std}}\\right] \\times 10^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscripts *sam* and *std* denote the $O$ isotope compositions of the sample and the isotope standard, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same notation is used for other elements. Different elements utilize different $\\delta = 0$ standards, however (see the table below). "

    "Equilibrium isotope fractionations typically arise from quantum mechanical effects on the vibrational motions of molecules. This needs to be explained! \n",

    "An isotope exchange reaction will run to minimize the energy of a given system. The energy of molecules can be described in terms of several components: nuclear, electronic, translational, rotational, and vibrational energy. The first two terms generally play no role in isotope fractionation. The translational and rotational energy terms typically also play no role or they are subordinate. The vibrational energy of molecules and the discrete vibrational energy levels, are thus the primary reason for the occurrence of equilibrium isotope fractionation in many reactions.\n",

    "Equilibrium isotope effects are temperature dependent. At low (room) temperature most molecules are in the vibrational ground state ($n=0$). At higher temperatures, many molecules will be in exited states, characterized by higher quantum numbers $n$. At high $n$, the differences between the energy levels of the different isotopes become smaller. Therefore, equilibrium isotope effects are smaller at higher temperature. \n",

    "### Theory of Isotope Fractionation \n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding discussion provided a basic overview of why equilibrium isotope effects occur in nature. Equilibrium isotope fractionation requires that a system actually attains thermodynamic equilibrium. Many reactions in nature never achieve equilibrium, however, because they are too slow or because the product is removed from the system before equilibrium is reached. The latter is often the case for reactions in biological systems, where the reaction products may be immediately transported across a cell membrane once they are formed. In this case, the system will be operating far removed from an\n",
    "equilibrium state. Such systems can give rise to kinetic isotope effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic isotope effects are associated with fast, incomplete, or unidirectional processes. Common examples are free evaporation into vacuum, diffusion,\n",
    "dissociation reactions and biologically mediated processes. As an example, consider the diffusion of an ideal gas, such as $Ar$ at low pressure. The average kinetic energy of the $Ar$ atoms is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{kin} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ denotes the mass and $v$ the velocity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The different isotopes have the same kinetic energy, such that the velocities (and the diffusion coefficients $D$) of the isotopes $^{40}Ar$ and $^{36}Ar$ differ. The lighter isotopes have higher speeds, and hence they move (diffuse) faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "The kinetic isotope fractionation factor for diffusion can be calculated from the ratio of the isotopic velocities: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha = \\frac{D_{^{36}Ar}}{D_{^{40}Ar}} = \\frac{v_{^{36}Ar}}{v_{^{40}Ar}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{^{40}Ar}}{m_{^{36}Ar}}} = 1.054$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, diffusion of pure $Ar$ is expected to produce an isotopic effect of $5.4\\%$ for the ${^{40}Ar}/{^{36}Ar}$  ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same fractionation is expected for non-equilibrium evaporation of $Ar$ into a vacuum, where the isotope fractionation is governed solely by the velocities of the atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another mechanism of kinetic isotope fractionation reflects that molecules with heavier isotopes (and more stable bonds) are also commonly less reactive than molecules with lighter isotopes. For example, we saw earlier that it takes more energy to dissociate $D_2$ than $H_2$. The dissociation reaction is also slower for $D_2$. Thus, when a dissociation reaction does not reach equilibrium, the lighter isotopes are typically enriched in the reaction products because the reactant molecules with lighter isotopes react faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., photosynthesis or respiration) are commonly associated with large kinetic isotope effects, because such reactions generally do not achieve equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "The light isotopes are typically enriched in the reaction products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $^{12}C$ is enriched relative to $^{13}C$ in the products of photosynthesis\n",
    "- $^{32}S$ is enriched relative to $^{34}S$ in $H_2S$ produced by bacterial reduction of sulfate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons (which differ depending on the process):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faster diffusion of light isotopes (e.g., across a membrane)\n",
    "- Bonds of light isotopes react faster"
