    "## What is it?\n",
    "We have already considered the issue of temporal aliasing, which occurs when the sampling rate of our seismic data is too low to properly sample high-frequencies in the dataset. One of the solution is cutting away the aliased frequencies (>$f_{\\text{notch}}$) using filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "As seismic data is sampled also in the distance $x$ dimension, a similar issue of spatial aliasing can occur. Spatial aliasing can result in inaccurate representation of dips in our seismic data, leading to issues with migration and other dip dependant processes."

Large sampling interval/trace sapcing or highly dipping events are more prone to spatial aliasing."

Vice-versa, if there is no spatial aliasing in a dataset, can we increase the trace separation, making further processing cheaper without degrading the image.\n",
