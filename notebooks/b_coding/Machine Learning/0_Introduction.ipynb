Or perhaps she/he really loathes bad weather, and there's no way she'd go to the open day if the weather is bad. We can use perceptrons to model this kind of decision-making. One way to do this is to choose a weight $w_1=6$ for the weather, and $w_2=2$ and $w_3=2$ for the other conditions. The larger value of $w_1$ indicates that the weather matters a lot to my partner, much more than whether I join or the stay home policy. Finally, suppose we choose a threshold of 5 for the perceptron. With these choices, the perceptron implements the desired decision-making model, outputting 1 whenever the weather is good, and 0 whenever the weather is bad. It makes no difference to the output whether I want to join my partner, or whether Boris' spank those who do not stay at homes."

In other words, it'd be a different model of decision-making. Dropping the threshold means she/he is more willing to go to the festival under the same 3 circumstances."
