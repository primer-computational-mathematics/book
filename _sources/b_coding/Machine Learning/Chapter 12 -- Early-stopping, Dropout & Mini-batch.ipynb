In philosophy, the drop out increases the diversity of the net. With the `new blood' from the other neurons, each set of weights are different and are therefore more likely to perform better. The other explanation is that each neuron learns certain features in the data set, if lots of neurons learn a particular feature at the same time, then it would not be performing better than single individual neuron who is in charge of its own feature and then many of those neurons combined."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["A related heuristic explanation for dropout is given in one of the earliest papers to use the technique: \"This technique reduces complex co-adaptations of neurons, since a neuron cannot rely on the presence of particular other neurons.

In this, it's somewhat similar to L1 and L2 regularization, which tend to reduce weights, and thus make the network more robust to losing any individual connection in the network."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Mini-batch"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["There are a number of challenges in applying the gradient descent rule.
