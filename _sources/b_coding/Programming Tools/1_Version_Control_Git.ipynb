    "Now we will go through different commands and their effect on the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git clone <link>``` - creates a copy of the repo on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git add <file/directory>``` - adds changed files or whole directories to a \"staging area\", which we will later commit to our repository. It is the first part of the two-step process of creating a new snapshot (commit), which is essentially a copy of our project. Files must be added before the commit. It needs to be run with an argument, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git add text.txt``` - stages the ```text.txt``` file\n",
    "    \n",
    "    &ensp;```git add dir``` - stages the whole ```dir```\n",
    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git add . ``` - stages all the unstaged files, **very common**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git commit -m \"message\"``` - saves the snapshot in the project history. It works as a photo, anything staged with ```git add``` will become a part of this snapshot. It is a good practice to run it with the ```-m``` (message) flag followed by a brief message about what changes were made. Without ```-m``` you might be prompted to do it in a terminal text editor such as Vim. Read about the [Vim commands](https://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git status``` - shows the overview of the staging area: which files are staged, modified or untracked (not staged).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git pull``` - updates the local repository with the changes made on the remote one. If you work in a team and your friend committed code, you might want to ```git pull``` to have those changes on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git push``` - updates the remote repository with your commits. **You need to use this command to update the code on GitHub**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git init``` - initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking the directory. Adds a hidden subfolder required for the version control. Have a look at the exercises if you want to try it! \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git stash``` - this command is used quite infrequently. It locally saves the work that is not ready to commit and gives a clean working directory. For instance, when working on a new feature that's not complete, but an urgent bug needs attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git stash -u``` - saves the untracked files as well\n",
    "    \n",
    "    &ensp;```git stash pop``` - brings the stashed work back to the directory\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git fetch``` - downloads meta-data but does not change the files on your machine. It allows you to see the changes in the latest version of a branch but does not implement those changes. Followed by  ```git merge FETCH_HEAD``` works the same as  ```git pull```\n",
    "\n",
