The brute force solution is to check every pair of points in a list and find the minimum distance. This leads to \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\). However, there is a divide and conquer method which leads to a more efficient algorithm:\n",

    "6) The tricky part: Intuition says that finding the minimum distance in the strip requires \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) computation. However, let us notice the fact that each pair of points in one half is at minimum \\\\(min(d_L,d_R)\\\\) distance from each other. The only candidates for the new minimum distances are in the different halves. So we need to consider only the points in the `strip` which have a difference of \\\\(y\\\\) coordinate that is less than \\\\(min(d_L,d_R)\\\\)! It can be proven geometrically that for each point, we need to check at most 6 other points. Therefore this operation is \\\\(O(n)\\\\). Please have a look at the following diagram for digesting this step.\n",
