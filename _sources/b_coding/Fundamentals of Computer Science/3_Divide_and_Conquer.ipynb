    "*Divide and Conquer* algorithms are one of the major groups in the computer problem solving. The main idea is to split the more complicated tasks into independent subproblems that can be composed  in the solution. The term is closely related to [recursion](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/b_coding/Fundamentals%20of%20Computer%20Science/3_Recursion.html#recursion), but the approach does not always lead to recursive solutions."
