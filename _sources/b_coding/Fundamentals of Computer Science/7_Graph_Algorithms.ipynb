    "In broad tems. A graph (V,E) is an abstract structure consisting of nodes (*vertices*) and edges connecting some of them. Graphs can be directed or undirected which means that their edges can be traversed in one or both directions. Graphs can be unweighted or not, their edges can have assigned weights. There are several ways of representing graphs in computers, two of which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjecency matrix \\\\(A\\\\): Which are matrices consisting of \\\\(1\\\\) and \\\\(0\\\\). A \\\\(1\\\\) at a coordinates \\\\((i,j)\\\\) means that there is an edge from node \\\\(i\\\\) to node \\\\(j\\\\). For undirected graphs \\\\(A[i,j]\\\\) = \\\\(A[j,i]\\\\). Adjacency matricex are a compact way of representing *dense* graphs where the number of edges is close to \\\\(|V|^2\\\\). \n",
