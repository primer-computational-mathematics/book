    "\n",
    "* **The multiplication method** First we multiply the key by `0 < c < 1` and take the *fractional part* of `k * c` which is `k * c - floor(k * c)`. This method leads to fewer overlaps and therefore we will use it in our implementation. Some values of `c` work better statistically. `c ~ (sqrt (5) – 1) / 2 ` is likely to work well.\n",

Each entry in the table will be a linked list-like object. In case of an overlap, we will append at the end of such a list. Of course, in the case when all elements *collide* we will one big linked-list object. The role of our hash function is to minimise the probability of this happening.\n",

    "Let `n` denote the number of elements in the hash table. The *load factor* is defined as `n / table_size`. As our table becomes more filled more cells (on average) become linked lists. To counter this effect we will double the size of the table when the load factor reaches a certain value (in our case \\\\(1\\\\)). We will not support deletion therefore shrinking is not essential.\n",
