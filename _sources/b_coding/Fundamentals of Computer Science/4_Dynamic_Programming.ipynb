Now, as we generate the next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, we will remember them for further use. The *trade-off between memory and time* is dramatic in this case.

    "1) **Optimal substructure**: In broad terms, that solution to the problem can be formulated in terms of independent subproblems. Then you choose a solution/combination of optimal solutions to subproblems and show that this choice leads to an optimal global solution. For example, for the `shortestPath` problem we choose between the optimal solution to the tile above and tile to the left. For the rod problem, we choose between all possible \\\\(n\\\\) cuts of a rod and assume we have solutions to the shorter rods.  \n",
