    "* **Dynamic Fibonnacci** If you have read the section about [recursion](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/b_coding/Fundamentals%20of%20Computer%20Science/2_Recursion.html#recursion) you probably know that the basic inplementation for generating Fibonacci numbers is very inefficient (\\\\(O(2^n)\\\\)!). Now, as we generate next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, we will memoize them for further use. This *trade-of between memory and time* is dramatic in this case.
