Now, as we generate next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, we will memoize them for further use. This *trade-of between memory and time* is dramatic in this case.

    "\n",
    "1) Optimal substructure: In broad terms, that solution to the problem can be formulated in terms of independent subproblems. Then you choose solution/combination of optimal solutions to subproblems and show that this choice leads to an optimal global solution. For example, for the `shortestPath` problem we choose between the optimal solution to the tile above and tile to the left. For the rod problem, we choose between all possible \\\\(n\\\\) cuts of a rod and assume we have solutions to the shorter rods.  \n",

    "2) Overlapping subproblems: The subproblems which we split the main question into should repeat. Eliminating the need to recompute the subproblems (by memoising them) should speed up out algorythm. For example, `dynamicFib` used two variables to keep the results of computing previous Fibonacci numbers."
