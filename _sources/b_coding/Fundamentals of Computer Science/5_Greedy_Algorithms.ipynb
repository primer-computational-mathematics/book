    "Greedy Algorithms is one of the paradigms of algorithmic problem solving. All greedy algorithms share the assumption that local optimal steps lead to the globally optimal solution. Quite surprisingly, this is often a valid assertion. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to have a good grasp on the topic, please have a look at [Dynamic Programming](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/b_coding/Fundamentals%20of%20Computer%20Science/4_Dynamic_Programming.html#dynamic-programming) section beforehand.\n",

    "* **Greedy Scheduling** We are given a list `timeslots` wih each element being a tuple \\\\((s,f)\\\\) where \\\\(s\\\\) is the starting time of the event and \\\\(f\\\\) its the finish time. We need to choose a subset of non-overlapping `timeslots` that has the most elements. Return the number of elements in that subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us assume that `timeslots` is sorted by \\\\(f\\\\) (non-decreasing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us show that the problem has an optimal substructure. Let \\\\(S_{ij}\\\\) denote a set of events which start after event \\\\(a_i\\\\) and finish before the event \\\\(a_j\\\\) and \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) be the optimal subset of \\\\(S_{ij}\\\\). We can see that \\\\(A_{ij} = A_{ik} + a_k + A_{kj}\\\\) for \\\\(i\\leq k \\leq j\\\\). Now \\\\(A_{ik}\\\\) is the solution for  \\\\(A_{ik}\\\\) and \\\\(A_{kj}\\\\) solves \\\\(S_{kj}\\\\). These are two independent subproblems, so the problem has an optimal substructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can have a thought how, based on this information, one can implement Dynamic solution. However, let us jump straight into Greedy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is to always choose the task that ends the earliest. We will show that (some optimal) \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) always contains the earliest ending task \\\\(a_m\\\\) of \\\\(\\\\(S_{ij}\\\\). Then, inductively, we know that this leads to globally optimal arrangement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**: Let \\\\(a_n\\\\) be the earliest ending task in \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) (does not have to be the same as \\\\(a_m\\\\)). If \\\\(a_n == a_m\\\\) then we are done. Otherwise, it is possible to swap \\\\(a_n\\\\) with \\\\(a_m\\\\) keeping \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) valid. As \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) was optimal, such swap still makes it optimal. \n",

If the item is not, we can replace with other items and improve or stay the same, again solution is optimal so the result can only stay the same.
