    "Greedy Algorithms are one of the paradigms of algorithmic problem-solving. All greedy algorithms share the assumption that local optimal steps lead to the globally optimal solution. Quite surprisingly, this is often a valid assertion. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to have a good grasp on the topic, please have a look at [Dynamic Programming](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/b_coding/Fundamentals%20of%20Computer%20Science/4_Dynamic_Programming.html#dynamic-programming) section beforehand.\n",

    "* **Greedy Scheduling** We are given a list `timeslots` with each element being a tuple \\\\((s,f)\\\\) where \\\\(s\\\\) is the starting time of the event and \\\\(f\\\\) its the finish time. We need to choose a subset of non-overlapping `timeslots` that has the most elements. Return the number of elements in that subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us assume that `timeslots` is sorted by \\\\(f\\\\) (non-decreasing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us show that the problem has an optimal substructure. Let \\\\(S_{ij}\\\\) denote a set of events which start after event \\\\(a_i\\\\) and finish before the event \\\\(a_j\\\\) and \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) be the optimal subset of \\\\(S_{ij}\\\\). We can see that \\\\(A_{ij} = A_{ik} + a_k + A_{kj}\\\\) for \\\\(i\\leq k \\leq j\\\\). Now \\\\(A_{ik}\\\\) is the solution for  \\\\(S_{ik}\\\\) and \\\\(A_{kj}\\\\) solves \\\\(S_{kj}\\\\). These are two independent subproblems, so the problem has an optimal substructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can have a thought about how, based on this information, one can implement Dynamic solution. However, let us jump straight into greedy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is to always choose the task that ends the earliest. We will show that (some optimal) \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) always contains the earliest ending task \\\\(a_m\\\\) of \\\\(S_{ij}\\\\). Then, inductively, we know that this leads to a globally optimal arrangement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**: Let \\\\(a_n\\\\) be the earliest ending task in \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) (does not have to be the same as \\\\(a_m\\\\)). If \\\\(a_n = a_m\\\\) then we are done. Otherwise, it is possible to swap \\\\(a_n\\\\) with \\\\(a_m\\\\) keeping \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) valid. As \\\\(A_{ij}\\\\) was optimal, such swap still makes it optimal. \n",
