    "# Google Earth Engine getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com) combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface through a cloud based platform. Hence offering the capability of running your algorithms and only requiring to export or visualise the output. The archive includes more than 30 years of historical imagery and scientific datasets, updated and expanded daily. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an informative background read on GEE and its applications see the following [hyperlink](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900?via%3Dihub).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main [GEE guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) covers everything from installation to available functions and usage, for an extensive range of examples see [here](https://github.com/giswqs/earthengine-py-notebooks). Here we will cover the basic important key points that should walk you through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you should apply for access to use the GEE. follow this [link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), if you cannot login yet it will tell you what steps you should follow to apply for access. Do this as soon as possible, I got access within a few minutes, however it says it can take a few days potentially. Referencing you are from Imperial and it is for research should get you access. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to access GEE using python you can install geemap which will automatically install all its dependencies like earthengine-api, folium and ipyleaflet. This allows for several methods to intereact with Earh Engine data layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: A key difference between folium and ipyleaflet is that ipyleaflet is built upon ipywidgets and allows bidirectional communication between the front-end and the backend enabling the use of the map to capture user input, while folium is meant for displaying static data only. Note that Google Colab currently does not support ipyleaflet. Therefore, if you are using geemap with Google Colab, you should use import geemap.eefolium. If you are using geemap with binder or a local Jupyter notebook server, you can use import geemap, which provides more functionalities for capturing user input (e.g., mouse-clicking and moving)."

Following this [link](https://philippgaertner.github.io/2019/04/earth-engine-apps-inventory/) you can find many examples of these apps and try them out.
