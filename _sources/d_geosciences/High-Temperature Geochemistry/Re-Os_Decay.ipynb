Komatiites are very high degree mantle melts ($F > 20\\%$) with relatively high $Re$ and $Os$ abundances of ~$1$ to $5$ $ppb$. Hence, they are comparatively easy to analyze for $Re$-$Os$ isochron studies. The $Re$-$Os$ decay system also provides one of the few means to date iron meteorites, which are essentially devoid of lithophile trace elements, such as $Rb$, $Sr$, $Hf$, and the REE.
