# Geodynamics (Fluid Dynamics)

Below is the list of contents which are mainly acquired from or related to the second part (Fluid Dynamics, Lecture 5-8) of the Geodynamics module and not shared significantly with other modules. In this module, we explore the dynamics of the viscous mantle. The exercises are based on Turcotte & Schubert (2nd or 3rd edition).
