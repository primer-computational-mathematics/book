In the former case the SI units are watts ($W$) with dimensions $[ML^{2}T^{-3}]$ and confusingly it is also commonly given the same symbol as heat ($Q$). In the latter case, its SI units are $W\\,m^{-2}$, and its dimensions are $[MT^{-3}]$.

Constant pressure and constant volume are two common conditions leading to two specific heats $c_p$ and $c_v$. For gases these two specific heats are significantly different, but for solids and liquids they are similar in size. Because large stresses may be involved in changing the temperature of a solid while keeping its volume constant, $c_p$ is nearly always the appropriate specific heat to use in the solid Earth sciences.\n", "\n", "### Latent heat\n", "\n", "Changes in phase at constant temperature, for example from solid to liquid or from gabbro to eclogite, typically involve a transfer of heat into or out of the surroundings. This happens because the phase change involves the internal rearrangement of inter-atomic and intermolecular forces, and energy is absorbed or released as a consequence. The total heat $Q$ involved in the phase change depends upon both the latent heat $L$ of the particular phase change and upon the total mass m of material involved, $Q = Lm$. The latent heat can be positive or negative.\n", "\n", "Latent heat associated with solid-state phase changes in the mantle appear to play a significant role in controlling the geometry of mantle convection.

If, however, temperature varies linearly with distance, between two points where temperature remains fixed with time, then there is no change in temperature with time.
