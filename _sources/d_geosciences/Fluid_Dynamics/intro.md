# Fluid dynamics


The aims of this project provide a complimentary material for the second part of the Geodynamics module, in which we explore the dynamics of the viscous mantle. It will cover the exercises from lecture five to lecture eight. The exercises are based on Turcotte & Schubert (2nd or 3rd edition).
