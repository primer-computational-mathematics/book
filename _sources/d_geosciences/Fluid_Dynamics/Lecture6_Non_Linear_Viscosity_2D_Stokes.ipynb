    "Although fracture is important in shallow crustal rock at low temperatures and pressures, there are many circumstances in which rock behaves as a ductile material. In determining the transition from brittle to ductile behavior, pressure, temperature, and strain rate are important. "

    "At temperatures that are a signiﬁcant fraction of the melt temperature the atoms and dislocations in a crystalline solid become suﬃciently mobile to result in creep when the solid is subjected to deviatoric stresses. At very low stresses diﬀusion processes dominate, and the crystalline solid behaves as a Newtonian ﬂuid with a viscosity that depends exponentially on pressure and the inverse absolute temperature. "
