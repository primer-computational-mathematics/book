However, this is just a name we give to the matrix, and it should be well known by now that those doing Engineering and Sciences are not the best people at naming various things. We could have equally named this **c**, or **z**, or **insert some other letter of the alphabet**, as long as we remember that this is a matrix used to store the variable. To help yourself in the future, you might want to write the letters used to represent the matrix in one color, for example, red, and the letters used to represent the variables or constants in the matrix in another color for example, blue, since you should have all those wonderful colored pens from your various field trips. This would be especially helpful during your Math Methods (or whatever they may have renamed this course to be in future) you are doing this year and next year to avoid confusion, and I mean this seriously, it really helps a lot. The matrices here were intentionally not colored to encourage you to write these things down in your favorite colored pens, and reinforce which are matrices and which are not, and totally not because I am too lazy to change the color,<span class= \"irony\"><span style=\"color:red\"> TOTALLY NOT!

What are the various different factors that compelled you to make such a choice in such a situation, there could be billions of different things; even very trivial things could be important in your decision making, don't worry, you will learn how to make the computer do these equations for you, instead of doing them yourselves. The method introduced in this lecture, the Gaussian elimination is a classic, and you probably have been doing it without knowing about it. Actual real world examples would use much more advanced and sophisticated algorithms than Gaussian elimination to deal with these massive matrices, but Gaussian elimination is a good bridge between your A Level Math and becoming an AI or ML expert!)! This case arises when you solve a differential equation numerically on a discrete mesh or grid. Here you would typically obtain one unknown and one (discrete, linear or nonlinear) equation at every grid point.
