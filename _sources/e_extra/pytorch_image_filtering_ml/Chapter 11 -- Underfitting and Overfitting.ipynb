Let's look at the following figure."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<img src=\"images/threeModels.PNG\" width=\"650\">\n", "Figure 11.1"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Suppose we have a curve that separates the two groups, and we have three ways of separating them as shown in figure 1.21.

The second model has lower cost then the first one but its not perfect as in some dots are wrongly-categorised.

Those noises can be outliers due to the invisible variables in the dataset. For example, we all think that a student who has $GPA=4.0$ and $SAT=2400$ should be accepted by a good university. However, if the scores are fake or he cheated on the exams, or the student had criminal records, then he would of course be rejected. In this case, the model that has only two variables ($SAT$ and $GPA$) would not correctly predict the admission results. Again, this is the consequence of the invisible variables."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["If we can have additional variables for the scenarios we mentioned before in the example, then we would not have noises or outliers. However, we cannot obtain all variables in reality. For example, the admission officer was drunk the day he reviewed the student's profile and mistook his $4.0 GPA$ as $2.0 GPA$, and then he rejected this student. If we can obtain the variable of how drunk he was, then we can somehow predict how reliable his decision and take this into account in the model. Obviously, we cannot obtain the variable in real life. For some data points, therefore, it is reasonable to be wrongly-categorised. So the second model that has some outliers might actually be better than the third model that has the minimum cost."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["But here is the problem. How do we know if the outlier we saw is actually an outlier due to invisible variable or if it is just a noise. One obvious method would be finding 100 students with $GPA=4.0$ and $SAT=2400$ and check if most of them got accepted by a university. If so, then the one student who has the same profile but got rejected would be an outlier.
