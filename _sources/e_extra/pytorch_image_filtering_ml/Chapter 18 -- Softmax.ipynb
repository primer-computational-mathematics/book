    "The cross-entropy cost can be used to address the problem of learning slowdown. However, I want to briefly describe another approach to the problem, based on what are called softmax layers of neurons. Softmax is still worth understanding, in part because it's intrinsically interesting, and in part because we'll use softmax layers in our discussion of deep neural networks."

The fact that a softmax layer outputs a probability distribution is rather pleasing. In many problems it's convenient to be able to interpret the output activation $a^{(n)}_a$ as the network's estimate of the probability that the correct output is $a^{th}$ neuron in the output layer. So, for instance, in the MNIST classification problem, we can interpret $a^{(n)}_a$ as the network's estimated probability that the correct digit classification is the $a^{th}$ neuron."

I won't explicitly prove it, but it should be plausible that the activations from a sigmoid layer won't in general form a probability distribution. And so with a sigmoid output layer we don't have such a simple interpretation of the output activations."
