    "The **Dakota** project provides software for optimisation and uncertainty quantification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dakota can be used for a broad range of computational tasks as it enables design exploration, risk analysis, model calibration, and quantification of margins and uncertainty with computational models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended use of Dakota is to aid computational methods developed to better understand the complex physical systems they simulate. In many cases these simulations are used to find the optimal design of a system, or to make prediction for systems that can not be directly tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of these computational simulations can lead to better system designs and improved overall performance. Furthermore, a reduced dependence on physical testing can reduce development costs and quicken the design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, it will be presented how the Dakota library is used to automatize the parameter space investigated in a given computational model using python programming language."

    "As an example, in this simple case Dakota puts values ranging between 1 and 2 instead of Parameter1 'par1', and values ranging between 3 and 4 instead of Parameter2 'par2' from the template. According to the code above, Dakota will then calculate the product of Parameter1 and Parameter2 and grab the print statement into the tabular file 'file.dat'. In this example, Dakota will use the efficient global optimisation algorithm that will guess subsequent 'par1' and 'par2' values to maximise the output, i.e. the print statement from the template file."
