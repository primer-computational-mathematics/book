    "As a future researcher, professional or enthusiast you will find out that maintaing a high standard of code is a considerable challenge. This can get even harder when multiple programmers are involved. Coding can be very rewarding, but it is also full of pitfalls and requires a *trial-and-error* approach.  \n",

    "This is where **version control** comes in. It is a software which allows you to track the development of your coding project. It also enables your peers to work on different versions of the same structure. \n",

    "The most well known version control facility is [git](https://git-scm.com/) but there are others such as [mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/). We are going to tackle the former. There are many platforms that allow to host git repositories, but the most well known is [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is the one we are going to use. "

    "    &ensp;```git add text.txt``` - stages the ```text.txt``` file\n",

    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git add . ``` - stages all the unstaged files, **very common**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git commit -m \"message\"``` - saves the snapshot in the project hostory. It works like a photo, anything staged with ```git add``` will become a part of this snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git status``` - shows which files are staged, modified or untracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git pull``` - updates the local repository with the changes made on the remote one. If you work in a team and you friend commited code, you might want to ```git pull``` to have those changes on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git push``` - updates the remote repository with your commits. **You need to us this command to update the code on GitHub**."
