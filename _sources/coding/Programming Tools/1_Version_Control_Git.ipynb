This can get even harder when multiple programmers are involved. Coding can be very rewarding, but it is also full of pitfalls and requires a *trial-and-error* approach.  \n",

There are many platforms that allow to host git repositories, but the most well known is [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is the one we are going to use. "

    "Now we will go through different commands and their effect on the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git clone <link>``` - creates a copy of the repo on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git add <file/directory>``` - stages changes for a commit. It is the first part of the two-step process of creating a new snapshot. Files must to be added before the commit. It needs to be run with an argument e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git add text.txt``` - stages the ```text.txt``` file\n",
    "    \n",
    "    &ensp;```git add dir``` - stages the whole ```dir```\n",
    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git add . ``` - stages all the unstaged files, **very common**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git commit -m \"message\"``` - saves the snapshot in the project hostory. It works like a photo, anything staged with ```git add``` will become a part of this snapshot. It is a good practice to run it with the ```-m``` flag followed by a brief message what was done. Without ```-m``` you might be prompted to do it in a terminal text editor such as Vim, read about the [Vim commands](https://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git status``` - shows which files are staged, modified or untracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git pull``` - updates the local repository with the changes made on the remote one. If you work in a team and you friend commited code, you might want to ```git pull``` to have those changes on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git push``` - updates the remote repository with your commits. **You need to us this command to update the code on GitHub**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git init``` - initalizes a new Git repository and begins tracking the directory. Adds a hidden subfloder required for the version control. Have a look at the exercises if you want to try it! \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git stash``` - this command is used quite unfrequently. It locally saves the work that is not ready to commit and gives a clean working directory. For instance, when working on a new feature thatâ€™s not complete, but an urgent bug needs attention:\n",
    "\n",
    "    &ensp;```git stash -u``` - saves the untracked files a well\n",
    "    \n",
    "    &ensp;```git stash pop``` - brings th stashed work back to the directory\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git fetch``` - downloads meta-data but does not change the files on your machine. It allows you which files are changes in the latast version of a branch, but does no implement those changes. Follwed by  ```git merge FETCH_HEAD``` works the same as  ```git pull```\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```git log``` - shows a chronological commit history for a repo.\n",
