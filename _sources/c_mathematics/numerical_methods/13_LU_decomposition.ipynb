Time stepping this problem invovles solving the same linear system multiple times with different RHSs.\n", "\n", "## Theory\n", "\n", "To deal with this situation efficiently we decompose or factorise the matrix $A$ in such a way that it is cheap to compute a new solution vector $\\pmb{x}$ for any given RHS vector $\\pmb{b}$.

These matrices encode the steps conducted in Gaussian elimination, so we don't have to explicilty conduct all of the operations again and again.\n", "\n", "Mathematically, let's assume that we have already found/constructed a lower-triangular matrix ($L$ - where all entries above the diagonal are zero) and an upper-triangular matrix ($U$ - where all entries below the diagonal are zero) such that we can write\n", "\n", "$$ A = LU.$$\n", "\n", "In this case the matrix system we need to solve for $\\pmb{x}$ becomes\n", "\n", "$$ A\\pmb{x} = \\pmb{b} \\iff (LU)\\pmb{x} = L(U\\pmb{x}) = \\pmb{b}.$$\n", "\n", "Notice that the matrix-vector product $U\\pmb{x}$ is itself a vector, let's call it $\\pmb{c}$ for the time-being (i.e. $\\pmb{c}=U\\pmb{x}$).\n", "\n", "The above system then reads\n", "\n", "$$ L\\pmb{c} = \\pmb{b}, $$\n", "\n", "where $L$ is a matrix and $\\pmb{c}$ is an unknown.\n", "\n", "As $L$ is in the lower-triangular form, we can use forward substitution (generalising the back subsitution algorithm/code) to very easily find $\\pmb{c}$ in relatively few operations (we don't need to call the entire Gaussian elimination algorithm).\n", "\n", "Once we know $\\pmb{c}$ we then solve the second linear system\n", "\n", "$$ U\\pmb{x} = \\pmb{c},$$\n", "\n", "where now we can use the fact that $U$ is upper-triangular to use our back substitution algorithm again very efficiently to give the solution $\\pmb{x}$ we require.\n", "\n", "So for a given $\\pmb{b}$ we can find the corresponding $\\pmb{x}$ very efficiently, we can therefore do this repeatedly as each new $\\pmb{b}$ is given to us.\n", "\n", "Our challenge is therefore to find the matrices $L$ and $U$ allowing us to perform the decomposition $A=LU$.\n", "\n", "## Doolittle algorithm\n", "\n", "Recall the comment above on the $L$ and $U$ matrices encoding the steps taken in Gaussian elimination.
