The PDE will be Fourier transformed from the outset and due to the differentiation properties of Fourier Transforms this will lead to an ODE which is much easier to solve. It should also be noted that the FT method works best for infinite systems. Applying it to a finite system essentially reduces the problem into a Fourier series of modes with discrete wavelengths, rather than $k$ being continuous. For inhomogeneous boundary conditions, the FT usually yields a half-range Fourier series."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["(diff_eq)=\n", "## Diffusion equation in 1D\n", "\n", "We will apply the FT method on the (linear) diffusion equation for an infinite system\n", "\n", "$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\n", "\n", "where the diffusion coefficient $D$ is assumed to be independent of position.
