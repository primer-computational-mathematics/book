    "Consider the diffusion (heat) equation in the semi-infinite domain $ 0 \\leq x < \\infty $ and for $t \\geq 0 $:\n",

    "In Part II of Mathematics for Scientists and Engineers, class exercise C6.3 asks us the following: demonstrate that if $u \\equiv u(x, t)$ is a solution to the diffusion equation then so is the rescaled function $v(x, t) = u(\\sqrt{a}x, at)$, where $a$ is any constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not obvious why this is the case and why $v$ is of this form. But if any such rescaled function $v$ is also a solution, it means that our physical process is exactly the same if we look at large or small scale. Such a solution is therefore called a **self-similar solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would expect to have a self-similar solution when there is no characteristic length or time scale in the system. This is the case in the above problem, where we are considering an infinitely long rod in the $x$ direction. In practice this, of course, only means that the length of the rod must be *very* long. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can observe self-similar spreading of honey if we squeeze it onto a plate. This does not mean that we need an infinitely-long plate, but rather that we are far enough from the edges. In fact, even if we squeeze the honey such that it does not form a circular blob, the honey will correct for this and form a circular shape regardless of that and continue to spread as if it had started from a circular blob. Furthermore, the spreading rate will be the same regardless of how much honey there is at the beginning and its height profile will have the same shape at all times - if we \"zoom\" in onto the profile (or stretch it horizontally and vertically). This \"zooming\" is mathematically achieved through **affine transformations**.\n",

    "Note that if we choose $A = 1$ and $B = C^2$ these coincide with the original equations, so $ \\hat{u} = F(\\hat{t}, \\hat{x})$ is also a solution, for any $C$. Returning to original variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "$C$ is an arbitrary constant so it can be treated as an additional independent variable. Still, it is artificially introduced so the solution does not really depend on it. To hide it, we can choose $C = \\sqrt{t}$ or $C = x$. Let us choose the former:\n",

    "\n",
    "However, we still do not know what $f$ actually is. For that, we need to again find the derivatives of $u$ and substitute them in the original equation. Note that now $u$ is a function of $\\eta$ so we need to again use the chain rule. For example:\n",
